# Phase 1 Project

## Business Background

Microsoft is a technology corporation that deals with the production of computer software, consumer electronics, operating systems for personal computers, servers, phones and other intelligent devices.

### Business Problem

Microsoft wants to venture into the movie making business after seeing the success other companies have been able to achieve in this field. The purpose of this analysis is to answer the questions below, and translate the findings into insights the organization can utilise.

1. Which specific genres have the highest audience ratings? Does a movies' runtime affect its rating?
2. What is the correlation between the average movie rating and and the movie gross?
3. Does the amount of money put into producing a movie have an effect on the performance of the movie (profit)?

### The Data

For this analysis, datasets from the following online sites were used:

* Box Office Mojo
* IMDB
* The Numbers

## Data Cleaning

For missing values that occurred on a small percentage of records in the datasets, these rows were dropped. However, for missing values that occurred on a larger number of records, these values were replaced with more appropriate data. For rows with numerical data, missing values were replaced with the median of the respective columns, in order to avoid altering the distribution of the data while still maintaining the size of the dataset.

The data types of specific columns in the various datasets were adjusted accordingly, for the purpose of analysis.

There were no duplicates in the datasets used for this analysis.

### Conclusion

The following were concluded from the analysis:

* The top 5 genres with the highest average audience ratings are: Game-show, Music, Documentary, Sport, Biography.
* The movie runtime does not have a significant impact on the rating a movie receives.
* To some level, the audience rating influences both the domestic and worldwide gross of a movie.
* A larger production budget does not guarantee greater profits.

### Recommendations

Based on the findings of the analysis carried out, I would make the following recommendations to Microsoft as they venture into the movie production industry:

1. Seeing the performance of the Game-show genre as well as the Music genre in termms of audience ratings, I recommend making a Game-show centered around music. Such a show will receive a high audience rating, increasing its chances of bringing in a higher gross.
2. In terms of films, I recommend making sports documentaries as these are two movie genres that seem to receive high ratings on their own. Incorporating the two genres in a single film may have positive results as it will appeal to two different demographics.
3. For the same reasons as above, I recommend producing biographies about musicians or sportsmen/sportswomen.
